# 🔒 Escrow Checkout Implementation

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

### **Core Features**
- ✅ **Platform Charge First**: Funds go to platform, NOT seller
- ✅ **No transfer_data**: Seller payment deferred until release
- ✅ **HELD Status**: Orders held in escrow after payment
- ✅ **Platform Fee Calculation**: 8% fee computed and tracked
- ✅ **Webhook Processing**: Automated status updates

---

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Checkout Flow**
```
1. Buyer → POST /orders/:listingId/checkout
2. Create Stripe Checkout Session (platform charge)
3. Buyer completes payment
4. Webhook → checkout.session.completed
5. Order status → HELD
6. Funds held on platform
7. Later: Transfer (amount - fee) to seller
```

### **Key Endpoints**

#### **Create Checkout Session**
```http
POST /orders/:listingId/checkout
Authorization: Bearer BUYER_JWT_TOKEN

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "checkoutUrl": "https://checkout.stripe.com/...",
  "sessionId": "cs_test_...",
  "order": {
    "id": "order_id",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "amountCents": 250000,
    "platformFee": 20000
  }
}
```

#### **Stripe Webhook**
```http
POST /webhooks/stripe
Content-Type: application/json
Stripe-Signature: signature

Handles:
- checkout.session.completed → Status HELD
- payment_intent.succeeded → Confirmation
```

#### **Get Order Details**
```http
GET /orders/:orderId
Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "order": {
    "id": "...",
    "status": "HELD",
    "amountCents": 250000,
    "stripePaymentIntentId": "pi_...",
    "paidAt": "2025-08-09T...",
    "listing": {...},
    "buyer": {...}
  }
}
```

## 💰 **Platform Fee System**

### **Fee Calculation**
```javascript
const PLATFORM_FEE_BPS = 800; // 8%
const platformFee = Math.floor(amountCents * PLATFORM_FEE_BPS / 10000);

// Example: $2,500 order
// Platform fee: $2,500 × 800 ÷ 10,000 = $200
// Seller receives later: $2,500 - $200 = $2,300
```

### **Fee Storage**
- Platform fee calculated during checkout
- Stored in checkout session metadata
- Used later for seller transfer calculation

---

## 🔄 **Order Status Flow**

```
PENDING → Checkout created, awaiting payment
   ↓
HELD → Payment completed, funds on platform
   ↓
PAID → Funds transferred to seller (next feature)
```

### **Database Schema**
```sql
model Order {
  id                    String    @id @default(cuid())
  listingId             String
  buyerId               String
  amountCents           Int
  paymentMethod         String    @default("stripe")
  stripePaymentIntentId String?   -- Payment intent ID
  status                String    @default("PENDING") -- PENDING, HELD, PAID
  createdAt             DateTime  @default(now())
  paidAt                DateTime? -- When payment completed
  releasedAt            DateTime? -- When funds released to seller
}
```

## 🎯 **Testing Results**

### **Checkout Session Creation** ✅
```
POST /orders/{listingId}/checkout
→ Creates Stripe Checkout Session
→ Funds charged to platform (no transfer_data)
→ Order status: PENDING
→ Platform fee: calculated
→ Checkout URL: ready for payment
```

### **Webhook Processing** ✅
```
Stripe → /webhooks/stripe
→ checkout.session.completed event
→ Order status: PENDING → HELD
→ stripePaymentIntentId: stored
→ paidAt: timestamp recorded
→ Listing status: ACTIVE → SOLD
```

### **Platform Balance** ✅
- Full payment amount goes to platform
- No immediate transfer to seller
- Platform controls when to release funds
- Fee automatically deducted on release

---

## 🔒 **Security & Validation**

### **Authorization Checks** ✅
- Buyer must be authenticated
- Cannot buy own listing
- Listing must be ACTIVE
- No duplicate orders on same listing

### **Webhook Security** ✅
- Stripe signature verification
- Raw body parsing for webhooks
- Metadata validation
- Error handling and logging

### **Data Integrity** ✅
- Atomic database operations
- Order → Listing relationship maintained
- Payment intent tracking
- Status consistency

---

## 📋 **Acceptance Criteria Met**

### ✅ **Create Checkout Session**
- `POST /orders/:listingId/checkout` implemented
- Stripe Checkout Session with platform charge
- No `transfer_data` - funds stay on platform
- Order stored with status "HELD" after payment

### ✅ **Webhook Processing**
- `POST /webhooks/stripe` endpoint
- Handles `checkout.session.completed`
- Updates order with `stripePaymentIntentId`
- Confirms status "HELD"

### ✅ **Platform Fee Calculation**
```javascript
platformFee = Math.floor(amount * PLATFORM_FEE_BPS / 10000)
// Later transfer: (amount - platformFee) to seller
```

### ✅ **Test Card Payment**
- Can start checkout
- Pay with test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
- Order shows status HELD
- stripePaymentIntentId recorded
- Platform balance increases by full amount

## 🚀 **Ready for Next Phase**

The escrow system is complete and ready for:

1. **✅ Checkout Creation**: Platform charges implemented
2. **✅ Payment Holding**: Funds held on platform
3. **✅ Status Tracking**: HELD status confirmed
4. **🔄 Next**: Fund release to sellers (transfer implementation)

### **Test with Real Flow**
1. Start checkout: `POST /orders/{listingId}/checkout`
2. Visit checkout URL in browser
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Complete payment
5. Webhook updates order to HELD
6. Check platform Stripe dashboard for increased balance

**The escrow "hold then release" system is fully functional!** 🎉
