# Mountain Highway Fund Release System - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 **ESCROW "HOLD THEN RELEASE" SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL**

The Mountain Highway marketplace now has a complete fund release system that allows the platform to hold funds in escrow and release them to sellers after successful transactions.

---

## 🔧 **New Endpoints Implemented**

### **Fund Release Endpoints**
- **POST `/orders/:orderId/release-funds`** - Release funds to seller (admin only)
- **POST `/orders/:orderId/refund`** - Process refunds (admin only)

### **Admin Dashboard Endpoints**
- **GET `/admin/orders/held`** - View all orders awaiting fund release
- **GET `/admin/orders/stats`** - Platform statistics and revenue metrics
- **GET `/admin/users/stats`** - User activity and verification statistics

### **Delivery Tracking Endpoints**
- **POST `/orders/:orderId/mark-shipped`** - Mark order as shipped (seller only)
- **POST `/orders/:orderId/mark-delivered`** - Mark order as delivered (seller only)
- **POST `/orders/:orderId/confirm-delivery`** - Confirm delivery (buyer only)

---

## 💰 **Fund Release Flow**

### **1. Order Creation**
- Buyer creates order via checkout
- Platform captures full payment (item price + fees)
- Order status: `PENDING`

### **2. Payment Processing**
- Stripe webhook confirms payment
- Order status: `PENDING` → `HELD`
- Funds held in platform account (not transferred to seller yet)

### **3. Delivery Process**
- Seller marks order as shipped: `deliveryStatus: "SHIPPED"`
- Seller marks order as delivered: `deliveryStatus: "DELIVERED"`
- Buyer confirms delivery: `deliveryStatus: "CONFIRMED"`

### **4. Fund Release** (New!)
- Admin reviews held orders via dashboard
- Admin releases funds to seller
- Platform transfers seller amount to Stripe Connect account
- Platform retains 8% fee
- Order status: `HELD` → `PAID`

---

## 🏦 **Financial Calculations**

```javascript
// Example: $25.00 order
const orderAmount = 2500; // cents
const platformFee = Math.floor(2500 * 800 / 10000); // 8% = $2.00
const sellerAmount = 2500 - 200; // $23.00

// Platform keeps: $2.00
// Seller receives: $23.00
```

## 🛡️ **Security & Access Control**

### **Admin Protection**
- Admin endpoints require authentication + admin role check
- Currently uses email-based admin list (replaceable with role system)
- Non-admin users get 403 Forbidden response

### **Role-Based Access**
- **Sellers only**: Mark shipped/delivered
- **Buyers only**: Confirm delivery
- **Admins only**: Release funds, view dashboard, process refunds
- **Platform**: Automatic webhook processing

### **Fund Safety**
- Funds never leave platform control until admin approval
- All transfers logged with order metadata
- Refund capability for disputes/cancellations

---

## 📊 **Admin Dashboard Features**

### **Held Orders Dashboard**
